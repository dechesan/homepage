One-sentence description of how I chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap:
    I used JavaScript to insert the html for my navbar at the start of each HTML file to avoid to
    copy it to each page.
    
    As for Bootstrap, I used the following components:
        Offcanvas Dark Navbar - For the navbar
        Card                  - To display each of my projects
        Carousel              - To show different images within the project cards
        Email field           - For user's email in contact form
        Text field            - For user's message in contact form
        Button                - For submitting contact form
